Your task is to design a chatbot that can connect to the chatroom as a client and respond to commands
from other clients.

ARCHITECTURE

   client(s)      chatroom         chatbot
  +--------+     +---------+      + - - - +
  |  (n)   |-----|         |- - - -       -
  +--------+     +---------+      + - - - +

Clients send messages to the chatroom.  Some of those messages should be interpreted as commands
by the chatbot, which will respond to the chatroom with an answer (a new message).  The response
will be relayed to all n clients.

COMMANDS

The two commands you need to implement are:

!echo - should return to the chatroom a user's message
  Example:
    user sends: "!echo jiminy cricket"
    bot responds: "jiminy cricket"

  Example:
    user sends: "!echo !echo"
    bot responds: "!echo"

!eval - should return to the chatroom the result of one four-function (+,-,*,/) space-separated calculation on two integers
  Example:
    user sends: "!eval 4 * 8"
    bot responds: "32"

  Example:
    user sends: "!eval 4 * 8 * h"
    bot responds: "Invalid input to eval"

  Example:
    user sends: "!eval 84 / 2"
    bot responds: "42"

Design a unit test for the eval function you write for the chatbot.

We should be able to build your chatbot with 'make chatbot' and run it with './chatbot <hostname_or_ip> <portnum>'.
We will use Ubuntu 16.04 with g++ and libboost-all-dev installed to build and test your code.

Finally, there is a bug we have observed in the existing code when sending
very long messages (around 300 characters or more). Please find it and fix it.


ENVIRONMENT

As a possible aid in getting a functional environment, we have included some docker commands.

If run from within this repository, /host within the container will be mapped to the present working directory.

To start an Ubuntu16 container:
  docker run -d -it --name chatapp -v `pwd`:/host ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash

To connect to the running container:
  docker exec -it chatapp /bin/bash


To install g++ and boost inside the container (480MB):
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y g++ libboost-all-dev make

To build inside the container:
  cd /host
  make


To stop a running container:
  docker stop chatapp

To remove a container:
  docker rm chatapp
