This repository contains a simple chat application, lightly adapted from the boost::asio examples available online.

BUILDING

There are two main make targets, 'client' and 'chatroom'.
'make all' will build both.

You will need a g++ version (4.9.0 or greater) that supports the c++14 standard and you will need the boost library for c++.
On Ubuntu 16.04, the g++ installed by default is sufficient and the package for boost is libboost-all-dev.

RUNNING

To run the chatroom, type './chatroom <portnum>'.
To run a client and connect to the chatroom, type './client <hostname_or_ip> <portnum>'.

The chatroom will echo all messages it receives from all clients to all other clients.
To send a message from a client prompt, type something and press enter.  The message will propagate to all other connected clients.

TODO

Complete the items in tasks.txt.
Our intention is for this to take 3-4 hours. You may take more time if you wish.
